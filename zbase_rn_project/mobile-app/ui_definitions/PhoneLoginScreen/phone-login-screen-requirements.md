# Phone Login Screen Requirements

- implement the PhoneLoginScreen according to this UI definition image:

- after entering the phone-number and clicking the "Continue to verify Phone" button, the screen should change the layout to show the SMS confirmation inputs (6 little squared inputs, like is shown in the UI definition image)

- use the button from LINK_TO_BUTTON

- modify LINK_TO_WELCOME-SCREEN so that when the user taps the "Create Account Button", it is taken to this new PhoneLoginScreen
